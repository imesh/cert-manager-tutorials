# Cert Manager Tutorials

[Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.
I created a set of tutorials for illustrating how cert-manager can be used in Kubernetes environments for above purposes.
